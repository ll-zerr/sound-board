## Features

- Clickable buttons that play the corresponding sounds.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## My Process

- Start the files from a boiler template.
- Add the audio tags in the index.html.
- Add JavaScript to target the buttons and play a specific sound for each button when clicked.
- Add styles for visual appeal.
- Update JavaScript to ensure only one sound is heard if multiple buttons are clicked in quick succession.

### Continued development

This is the first time I have used the HTML5 audio tags. My goal is to take this lesson and apply it to a more complex project.
